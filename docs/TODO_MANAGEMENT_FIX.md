# TODO Management Bug Fix - Usage Examples

## Issue Summary

The `manage_todo_json` tool was failing with "Invalid input" errors when users tried to update task status using simple, natural commands. This was blocking critical deployment verification workflows.

## Root Cause

The schema required a `reason` field for all `update_task` and `bulk_update` operations, but users were not providing it in their commands.

## Solution

Made the `reason` field **optional** with sensible defaults:
- `update_task`: defaults to "Task updated"  
- `bulk_update`: defaults to "Bulk status update"

## Working Commands (After Fix)

### ✅ Simple Status Update
```bash
mcp_adr-analysis_manage_todo_json:
  operation: "update_task"
  taskId: "e96ee5d4"
  updates: {"status": "completed"}
  # reason field is now optional - defaults to "Task updated"
```

### ✅ Progress Update  
```bash
mcp_adr-analysis_manage_todo_json:
  operation: "update_task"
  taskId: "e96ee5d4" 
  updates: {"progressPercentage": 100, "status": "completed"}
  # reason field is now optional - defaults to "Task updated"
```

### ✅ Bulk Update (Fixed Structure)
```bash
mcp_adr-analysis_manage_todo_json:
  operation: "bulk_update"
  updates: [
    {"taskId": "task1", "status": "completed"},
    {"taskId": "task2", "status": "completed"}
  ]
  # reason field is now optional - defaults to "Bulk status update"
  # updates is now correctly an array of task updates
```

### ✅ With Custom Reason (Backward Compatible)
```bash
mcp_adr-analysis_manage_todo_json:
  operation: "update_task"
  taskId: "e96ee5d4"
  updates: {"status": "completed"}
  reason: "ArgoCD deployment verified - 8 pods running successfully"
```

## ServiceNow-OpenShift Integration Example

For the deployment verification scenario described in the issue:

```bash
# Deploy and verify ArgoCD
mcp_adr-analysis_manage_todo_json:
  operation: "update_task"
  taskId: "argocd-task-id"
  updates: {"status": "completed", "progressPercentage": 100}
  reason: "ArgoCD deployed: 8 pods running in openshift-gitops namespace"

# Deploy and verify ESO  
mcp_adr-analysis_manage_todo_json:
  operation: "update_task"
  taskId: "eso-task-id"
  updates: {"status": "completed", "progressPercentage": 100}
  reason: "ESO deployed: 4 pods running, secrets management functional"

# Deploy and verify Keycloak
mcp_adr-analysis_manage_todo_json:
  operation: "update_task" 
  taskId: "keycloak-task-id"
  updates: {"status": "completed", "progressPercentage": 100}
  reason: "Keycloak deployed: 3 pods running, authentication working"
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Usage**: No need to provide reason for simple status updates
2. **Better UX**: Commands work as users naturally expect
3. **Accurate Tracking**: Project completion now reflects reality (92% actual vs previous 39% tracked)
4. **Backward Compatible**: Explicit reason field still works
5. **Better Errors**: More specific validation messages when something is wrong

## Validation

The fix has been tested with:
- ✅ All exact commands from the original issue report
- ✅ ServiceNow-OpenShift integration deployment scenarios  
- ✅ Comprehensive automated test suite
- ✅ Manual end-to-end validation
- ✅ Regression testing of existing functionality

Project health scoring now accurately reflects task completion status, enabling proper deployment readiness assessment and GitOps workflow integration.
