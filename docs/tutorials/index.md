Learning-oriented guides for newcomers

## Available Guides

This section contains tutorials documentation following the Diataxis framework.

**Tutorials** are learning-oriented and help newcomers get started:

- Take the reader through a process step by step
- Focus on learning by doing
- Ensure the reader succeeds in accomplishing something
- Build confidence through success

## üîç Research-Driven Architecture

All tutorials now feature **research-driven workflows** that query your live environment instead of relying on static analysis alone:

- **Cascading Source Hierarchy**: Project Files ‚Üí Knowledge Graph ‚Üí Environment Resources ‚Üí Web Search
- **Confidence Scoring**: Every result includes a 0-1 confidence score
- **Live Infrastructure Detection**: Automatically discovers Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Podman, Ansible
- **Red Hat Ecosystem Support**: First-class support for OpenShift (`oc`), Podman, and Ansible
- **ADR Validation**: Check if documented decisions match actual implementation

## üß† Context File - Your Project's Memory

Every tutorial teaches you to use **`.mcp-server-context.md`** - the auto-generated file that tracks your progress, patterns, and decisions:

- üí° **In Tutorial 1**: Learn to track your progress with `@.mcp-server-context.md`
- üîÑ **In Tutorial 2**: Resume work seamlessly by reviewing past analysis
- üéØ **In Tutorial 3**: Master advanced decision-making with pattern analysis

Just use `@.mcp-server-context.md` in your AI assistant to access your project's living memory!

### Key Research-Driven Tools

- **`perform_research`**: Ask questions about your project and get confidence-scored answers
- **`validate_adr`**: Validate a single ADR against live infrastructure
- **`validate_all_adrs`**: Batch validate all ADRs with environment checks
- **`analyze_deployment_progress`**: Research-enhanced deployment readiness analysis
- **`generate_deployment_guidance`**: Infrastructure-aware deployment recommendations
