## 🎯 What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:

- Set up multi-developer ADR workflows
- Implement collaborative decision review processes
- Establish team knowledge sharing practices
- Create standardized architectural documentation
- Manage distributed architectural decisions

## 🛠️ Prerequisites Check

Before starting, ensure you have:

```bash
# 1. MCP server installed for all team members
mcp-adr-analysis-server --test

# 2. Shared project repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/team-project.git
cd team-project

# 3. Team coordination tools ready
# - Slack/Teams for notifications
# - GitHub/GitLab for code reviews
# - Shared documentation platform
```

---

## 👥 Step 1: Team Setup and Standards

### 1.1 Establish Team ADR Standards

Create shared ADR configuration for consistency:

```bash
# Create team ADR configuration
mkdir -p .adr-config
cat > .adr-config/team-standards.json << 'EOF'
{
  "adrDirectory": "docs/architecture/decisions",
  "template": "madr",
  "reviewProcess": {
    "requiredReviewers": 2,
    "architectureTeamReview": true,
    "securityReview": true
  },
  "namingConvention": "YYYYMMDD-decision-title",
  "categories": [
    "architecture",
    "security",
    "performance",
    "integration",
    "infrastructure"
  ],
  "stakeholders": {
    "architecture": ["@arch-team"],
    "security": ["@security-team"],
    "performance": ["@performance-team"]
  }
}
EOF
```

### 1.2 Create Team ADR Template

```json
{
  "tool": "generate_adr_template",
  "parameters": {
    "template": "team-collaborative",
    "includeStakeholders": true,
    "includeReviewProcess": true,
    "outputPath": "docs/architecture/adr-template.md"
  }
}
```

### 1.3 Initialize Shared ADR Directory

```bash
# Create standardized directory structure
mkdir -p docs/architecture/decisions
mkdir -p docs/architecture/reviews
mkdir -p docs/architecture/proposals

# Create ADR index
cat > docs/architecture/decisions/README.md << 'EOF'
# Architectural Decision Records

## Team Process

1. **Proposal Phase**: Create ADR draft in `proposals/` directory
2. **Review Phase**: Team review and discussion
3. **Decision Phase**: Move to `decisions/` with final status
4. **Implementation**: Track progress and outcomes

## Current Decisions

| ID | Title | Status | Date | Stakeholders |
|----|-------|--------|------|--------------|
| 001 | [Database Architecture](001-database-architecture.md) | Accepted | 2024-01-15 | @backend-team |
| 002 | [API Gateway Strategy](002-api-gateway-strategy.md) | Proposed | 2024-01-20 | @api-team |

## Review Schedule

- **Weekly ADR Review**: Fridays 2:00 PM
- **Architecture Sync**: Bi-weekly Mondays 10:00 AM
- **Emergency Reviews**: As needed via Slack #architecture
