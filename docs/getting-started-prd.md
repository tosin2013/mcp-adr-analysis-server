# üìã Getting Started: New Projects with PRD.md

This guide helps you bootstrap architectural decisions for new projects using a Product Requirements Document (PRD.md). You'll learn how to automatically generate ADRs from requirements and create a solid architectural foundation.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Software
- **Node.js** ‚â•18.0.0
- **MCP Client** (Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, or Windsurf)
- **PRD.md file** with your project requirements

### MCP Server Installation

```bash
# Global installation (recommended)
npm install -g mcp-adr-analysis-server

# Verify installation
mcp-adr-analysis-server --version
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Setup

```bash
export PROJECT_PATH="/path/to/your/new/project"
export ADR_DIRECTORY="docs/adrs"
export LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
export CACHE_ENABLED="true"
```

### MCP Client Configuration

#### Claude Desktop
Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "adr-analysis": {
      "command": "mcp-adr-analysis-server",
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_PATH": "/path/to/your/new/project",
        "ADR_DIRECTORY": "docs/adrs",
        "LOG_LEVEL": "INFO"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üìù PRD.md Requirements

Your PRD.md should include these sections for optimal ADR generation:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## Technical Requirements
- Performance requirements
- Scalability needs
- Security requirements
- Integration requirements

## Architecture Constraints
- Technology preferences
- Platform requirements
- Compliance needs
- Budget constraints

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Availability requirements
- Maintainability needs
- Monitoring requirements
```

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Workflow

### Step 1: Generate ADRs from PRD

Transform your requirements into architectural decisions:

**Tool Call:**
```
generate_adrs_from_prd
```

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "prdPath": "PRD.md",
  "outputDirectory": "docs/adrs"
}
```

**What this does:**
- Analyzes your PRD.md file
- Identifies architectural decision points
- Generates appropriate ADRs for each decision
- Creates properly formatted ADR files

**Expected Output:**
- Multiple ADR files in `docs/adrs/` directory
- Each ADR addresses a specific architectural decision
- ADRs follow standard format (Context, Decision, Consequences)
- Numbered sequence (001-xxx.md, 002-xxx.md, etc.)

### Step 2: Validate Generated Decisions

Ensure the generated ADRs make sense for your project:

**Tool Call:**
```
analyze_project_ecosystem
```

**Parameters:**
```json
{}
```

**What this does:**
- Analyzes your project structure (if any exists)
- Validates ADR decisions against project context
- Identifies potential conflicts or gaps
- Suggests refinements

**Expected Output:**
- Validation report for generated ADRs
- Recommendations for adjustments
- Technology stack compatibility analysis

### Step 3: Create Enhanced TDD Implementation Roadmap

Generate actionable tasks using the new two-phase TDD approach:

**Tool Call:**
```
generate_adr_todo
```

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "scope": "pending",
  "phase": "both",
  "linkAdrs": true,
  "includeRules": true
}
```

**What this does:**
- Extracts implementation tasks from ADRs with TDD approach
- Links all ADRs to create system-wide test coverage
- Integrates architectural rules validation
- Creates both test specifications and implementation tasks
- Generates comprehensive development roadmap with validation checkpoints

**Expected Output:**
- `todo.md` file with TDD-focused implementation tasks
- Test specifications linking all ADRs for comprehensive coverage
- Implementation tasks with architectural rule compliance checks
- Prioritized list of architectural work with production readiness criteria
- Dependencies and sequencing information with validation gates

### Step 4: Establish Quality Validation Framework

Set up validation to ensure implementations meet ADR goals from the start:

**Tool Call:**
```
compare_adr_progress
```

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "todoPath": "todo.md",
  "adrDirectory": "docs/adrs",
  "deepCodeAnalysis": true,
  "functionalValidation": true,
  "strictMode": true,
  "includeTestCoverage": true,
  "validateDependencies": true
}
```

**What this does:**
- Establishes quality gates for new implementations
- Sets up mock vs production code detection patterns
- Creates validation criteria for each ADR goal
- Provides reality-check mechanisms for implementation progress
- Validates cross-ADR dependencies and system consistency

**Expected Output:**
- Quality validation framework configuration
- Implementation standards and patterns
- Validation checkpoints for each development phase
- Clear criteria for production readiness assessment

### Step 5: Research Critical Decisions

For complex decisions, generate research questions:

**Tool Call:**
```
generate_research_questions
```

**Parameters:**
```json
{
  "context": "Database selection for high-traffic application",
  "scope": "data_architecture",
  "researchAreas": ["performance", "scalability", "cost"]
}
```

**What this does:**
- Identifies areas needing additional research
- Generates specific research questions
- Creates research tracking templates
- Suggests validation approaches

## üß™ TDD Workflow for PRD-Based Projects

When starting from a PRD, the TDD workflow ensures your implementation matches the requirements:

### Phase 1: Generate Test Specifications from PRD-Generated ADRs

**Create comprehensive test specifications:**

```
Tool: generate_adr_todo
Parameters: {
  "phase": "test",
  "linkAdrs": true,
  "includeRules": true,
  "outputPath": "todo-tests.md"
}
```

**Benefits for PRD-based projects:**
- Validates that all PRD requirements are testable
- Creates system-wide test coverage based on architectural decisions
- Establishes clear acceptance criteria for each requirement
- Links business requirements to technical implementation through ADRs

### Phase 2: Generate Production Implementation from Tests

**Create implementation roadmap:**

```
Tool: generate_adr_todo
Parameters: {
  "phase": "production",
  "linkAdrs": true,
  "includeRules": true,
  "outputPath": "todo-implementation.md"
}
```

**Benefits for PRD-based projects:**
- Ensures implementation directly addresses PRD requirements
- Maintains traceability from PRD to ADRs to implementation
- Includes architectural rule compliance for all PRD-driven decisions
- Provides clear production readiness criteria

### Validation Against PRD Requirements

**Ensure implementations meet original PRD goals:**

```
Tool: compare_adr_progress
Parameters: {
  "todoPath": "todo.md",
  "adrDirectory": "docs/adrs",
  "projectPath": "/path/to/project",
  "deepCodeAnalysis": true,
  "functionalValidation": true,
  "strictMode": true,
  "prdValidation": true
}
```

**PRD-specific validation patterns:**
- Verifies functional requirements are actually implemented
- Checks non-functional requirements (performance, security) are met
- Validates business logic matches PRD specifications
- Ensures user experience requirements are addressed
- Confirms compliance requirements are satisfied

### Common PRD Implementation Pitfalls to Avoid

The validation system helps prevent:

**Requirements Drift:**
- Mock implementations that don't meet actual PRD requirements
- Features that work in isolation but don't integrate properly
- Performance implementations that don't meet PRD criteria
- Security implementations that don't address PRD compliance needs

**Traceability Loss:**
- Code that implements features not described in the PRD
- Missing implementations for critical PRD requirements
- ADRs that don't align with actual PRD priorities
- Tests that don't validate real PRD acceptance criteria

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**PRD Not Parsed Correctly**
- Ensure PRD.md follows standard markdown format
- Include clear section headers
- Provide specific technical requirements

**Generated ADRs Too Generic**
- Add more technical details to PRD
- Include specific constraints and preferences
- Use `suggest_adrs` to add missing specifics

**Missing Critical Decisions**
- Review generated ADRs for gaps
- Use `analyze_project_ecosystem` for validation
- Manually create ADRs for missed decisions

## üìà Best Practices

1. **Detailed PRD**: Include technical constraints and preferences
2. **Iterative Approach**: Generate, review, refine ADRs
3. **Research Integration**: Use research tools for complex decisions
4. **Validation**: Check ADRs against project constraints
5. **Implementation Planning**: Use todo generation for roadmap

## üîÑ Next Steps After ADR Generation
