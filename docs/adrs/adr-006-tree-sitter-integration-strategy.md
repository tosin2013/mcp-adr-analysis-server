# ADR-006: Tree-Sitter Integration Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The MCP ADR Analysis Server requires deep code analysis capabilities beyond simple pattern matching. Based on the project analysis and tree-sitter integration memories, the system implements comprehensive AST-level analysis using tree-sitter parsers for multiple languages including TypeScript, Python, YAML, and others. This enables accurate architectural pattern detection, security analysis, and code quality assessment.

## Decision

We will implement comprehensive tree-sitter integration across all analysis tools, providing AST-level code analysis with multi-language support and graceful fallbacks to regex-based analysis when parsers are unavailable.

Key components:

- **Multi-Language AST Analysis**: Support for TypeScript, Python, YAML, HCL, Dockerfile, and Bash
- **Enterprise DevOps Analysis**: Specialized analysis for Ansible, Kubernetes, Docker Compose
- **Security-Focused Parsing**: AST-level secret detection and security vulnerability analysis
- **Architectural Pattern Detection**: Code structure analysis for architectural compliance
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient parsing with file size limits and recursion controls
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Regex-based analysis when tree-sitter parsers unavailable

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Accurate code analysis through AST parsing reduces false positives
- Multi-language support enables comprehensive codebase analysis
- Enterprise DevOps analysis provides specialized infrastructure code insights
- Security analysis at AST level improves secret detection accuracy
- Architectural pattern detection enables sophisticated compliance validation
- Graceful fallbacks ensure analysis continuity even with parser issues

**Negative:**

- Increased complexity in managing multiple language parsers and their dependencies
- Performance impact on large codebases due to comprehensive AST parsing
- Memory requirements for parsing and storing AST representations
- Maintenance overhead for keeping parsers updated with language evolution
- Potential parsing failures requiring robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Learning curve for developers working with AST-based analysis logic
