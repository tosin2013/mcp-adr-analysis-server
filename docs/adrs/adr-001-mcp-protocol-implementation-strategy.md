# ADR-001: MCP Protocol Implementation Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The MCP ADR Analysis Server requires implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for communication with AI systems. The selection of transport protocol, message format, and tool architecture significantly impacts system performance, maintainability, and extensibility. The project requires a solution that balances compatibility, simplicity, and future extensibility while supporting dynamic tool integration.

## Decision

We will implement MCP using Server-Sent Events (SSE) as the primary transport protocol with JSON-RPC for message formatting, combined with a plugin-based tool architecture for extensibility. This approach provides HTTP/1.1 compatibility, simplifies client implementation, and enables dynamic tool registration without requiring core system modifications.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Enhanced HTTP compatibility with existing infrastructure
- Simplified client implementation due to SSE's straightforward nature
- Improved maintainability through modular plugin architecture
- Easier debugging and monitoring with standard HTTP tools
- Dynamic tool registration and extension without system restarts

**Negative:**

- Potentially higher latency compared to WebSockets for high-frequency messaging
- Increased complexity in managing tool interaction and lifecycle
- Additional overhead for plugin management and dependency resolution
- Requires careful state management in stateless HTTP connections
