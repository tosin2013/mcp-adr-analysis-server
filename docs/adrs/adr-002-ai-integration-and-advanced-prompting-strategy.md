# ADR-002: AI Integration and Advanced Prompting Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The MCP ADR Analysis Server integrates advanced AI capabilities for architectural analysis, including Knowledge Generation, Reflexion learning, and Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE). The system needs to provide high-quality analysis with confidence scoring, evidence-based recommendations, and systematic verification processes. The choice of AI integration approach affects analysis quality, response time, system complexity, and reliability.

## Decision

We will implement a hybrid AI integration approach using advanced prompting techniques (Knowledge Generation + Reflexion + APE) with external AI services, combined with local caching and methodological pragmatism framework for systematic verification and confidence scoring.

Key components:

- **Knowledge Generation**: Domain-specific architectural knowledge enhancement
- **Reflexion Learning**: Learning from past analysis outcomes and experiences
- **Automatic Prompt Engineering**: Optimized prompt generation for better results
- **Confidence Scoring**: Systematic confidence assessment for all recommendations
- **Evidence-Based Analysis**: All recommendations backed by concrete evidence
- **Methodological Pragmatism**: Explicit fallibilism and systematic verification

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Enhanced analysis quality with confidence scoring and evidence backing
- Systematic verification processes reduce false positives
- Learning from past experiences improves future analysis
- Methodological pragmatism provides structured approach to uncertainty
- Advanced prompting techniques improve AI response quality
- Local caching reduces latency and external service dependency

**Negative:**

- Increased complexity in prompt management and AI workflow orchestration
- Dependency on external AI services for advanced analysis
- Potential latency in analysis due to multi-step AI processing
- Need for sophisticated error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Higher computational costs due to advanced prompting techniques
- Complexity in managing confidence scoring and evidence validation
