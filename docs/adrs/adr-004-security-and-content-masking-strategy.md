# ADR-004: Security and Content Masking Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The MCP ADR Analysis Server processes sensitive code and architectural information that may contain secrets, credentials, and proprietary data. Based on the project analysis and security memories, the system implements comprehensive security scanning, content masking, and credential detection. The security approach must balance thorough analysis with protection of sensitive information.

## Decision

We will implement a multi-layered security strategy combining AI-powered content analysis, pattern-based detection, and intelligent masking with tree-sitter integration for deep code analysis.

Key components:

- **AI-Powered Security Analysis**: Advanced detection using AI models
- **Tree-Sitter Integration**: AST-level analysis for accurate secret detection
- **Content Masking**: Intelligent masking preserving analysis capability
- **Pattern Detection**: Configurable patterns for organization-specific secrets
- **Git History Protection**: Prevention of secrets in version control
- **Security Workflows**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD pipelines

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Comprehensive protection against secret exposure in analysis outputs
- AI-powered detection reduces false positives compared to regex-only approaches
- Tree-sitter integration provides accurate code-level security analysis
- Configurable patterns allow organization-specific security requirements
- Automated workflows prevent security issues in CI/CD pipelines
- Intelligent masking preserves analysis utility while protecting sensitive data

**Negative:**

- Increased processing time due to comprehensive security scanning
- Complexity in managing multiple detection methods and their coordination
- Potential for false positives requiring manual review and configuration
- Dependency on external AI services for advanced security analysis
- Risk of performance impact on large codebases during analysis
- Need for ongoing maintenance of security patterns and detection rules
