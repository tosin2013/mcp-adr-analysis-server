# ADR: Validated Patterns Framework for Multi-Platform Deployments

**Status**: PROPOSED

**Date**: 2025-01-16

**Decision Makers**: Architecture Team, DevOps Team

## Context

The existing bootstrap validation system had inconsistencies in how deployments were handled across different platforms and environments. Each deployment often required custom scripts and manual interventions, leading to:

1. **Inconsistent Deployments**: Different approaches for similar platforms
2. **No Standardization**: Lack of industry best practices
3. **Poor Reproducibility**: Difficult to recreate deployments
4. **Limited Learning**: No systematic capture of deployment knowledge
5. **Platform Silos**: Separate, incompatible approaches for each platform

The project needed a comprehensive, standardized approach to handle deployments across:

- OpenShift
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- Node.js
- Python
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers
- Agent-to-Agent (A2A) systems

## Research

Extensive research was conducted across all seven platforms to understand industry best practices:

### OpenShift Validated Patterns

Source: Red Hat Validated Patterns (https://play.validatedpatterns.io/)

**Key Principles**:

- Hierarchical values override system
- GitOps with ArgoCD
- Helm charts for templating
- Environment abstraction
- Secrets management with Vault

**Pattern Structure**:

- Common repository with core framework
- Bill of materials (operators, charts, scripts)
- Naming conventions (pattern name + cluster group name)
- Sync waves and hooks for orchestration

### Kubernetes Best Practices (2025)

Sources: CNCF, Kubernetes Documentation, Industry Blogs

**Core Deployment Strategies**:

- Rolling updates (gradual replacement)
- Blue/green deployments (zero-downtime swaps)
- Canary releases (progressive rollouts)
- A/B testing deployments

**Essential Practices**:

- Declarative YAML manifests
- Resource requests and limits
- Liveness and readiness probes
- Network policies for security
- GitOps workflows
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling

### Docker Containerization Patterns

Sources: Docker Documentation, Sysdig, Google Cloud

**Security Best Practices**:

- Multi-stage builds for smaller images
- Non-root user execution
- Read-only filesystems
- Distroless or scratch base images
- Regular vulnerability scanning

**Optimization Techniques**:

- Layer caching and ordering
- .dockerignore for build context
- Precise base image versions (avoid 'latest')
- Minimal package installation

### Node.js Microservices Patterns

Sources: LogRocket, Apriorit, Harness

**Deployment Approaches**:

- Containerization with Docker
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Serverless (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- PaaS (Heroku, Google App Engine)

**Key Patterns**:

- Database-per-service
- API gateways for aggregation
- Circuit breakers for resilience
- Centralized logging

### Python Application Patterns

Sources: Python Packaging Guide, Full Stack Python

**Deployment Strategies**:

- Traditional servers (Gunicorn/uWSGI + Nginx)
- Containerization (Docker + Kubernetes)
- PaaS platforms (Heroku, GCP)
- Serverless (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)

**Best Practices**:

- Virtual environments for isolation
- Requirements freezing
- CI/CD automation
- Security hardening (HTTPS, authentication)

### MCP Server Patterns

Sources: MCP Documentation, MCP Community Resources

**Architecture Best Practices**:

- Single-purpose servers (avoid monoliths)
- High-level tool grouping
- Structured error handling
- Schema validation with Pydantic

**Security Considerations**:

- HTTPS for HTTP transports
- OAuth 2.0/2.1 with PKCE
- URI validation and access control
- Never write to stdout for STDIO servers

**Deployment**:

- Docker containerization (60% reduction in support tickets)
- MCP Inspector for validation
- Detailed logging (40% reduction in debugging time)

### A2A Protocol Patterns

Sources: Linux Foundation, Google Developers, A2A Project

**Core Capabilities**:

- Capability discovery via Agent Cards (JSON)
- Task-oriented communication
- Multi-modal support (audio, video streaming)
- State management

**Technical Foundation**:

- JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S)
- Enterprise authentication (OpenAPI schemes)
- Real-time feedback and state updates
- Streaming and push notifications

**Industry Adoption**:

- 100+ technology companies
- Production-ready v1.0 by late 2025
- Complementary to MCP (A2A for agents, MCP for tools)

## Decision

We will implement a **Validated Patterns Framework** that:

1. **Defines Standard Patterns**: Create comprehensive pattern definitions for all seven platforms based on researched best practices

2. **Auto-Detects Platforms**: Build a platform detection system that automatically identifies project types using:
   - File system analysis (Dockerfile, package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
   - Content pattern matching
   - Dependency analysis
   - Confidence scoring

3. **Applies Patterns Consistently**: Implement a pattern application framework that:
   - Validates prerequisites
   - Creates required configuration files
   - Executes deployment phases in order
   - Runs validation checks
   - Sets up health monitoring

4. **Maintains Pattern Memory**: Integrate with the existing memory system to:
   - Store applied patterns for reuse
   - Track deployment successes and failures
   - Evolve patterns based on real-world experience
   - Provide recommendations for similar projects

5. **Supports Hybrid Deployments**: Enable multi-platform projects by:
   - Detecting multiple platforms simultaneously
   - Composing hybrid patterns
   - Managing platform-specific overrides

## Pattern Structure

Each validated pattern includes:

```typescript
{
  // Identification
  id, name, version, platformType, description,

  // Bill of Materials
  billOfMaterials: {
    dependencies: [/* tools, runtimes, SDKs */],
    configurations: [/* required config files */],
    secrets: [/* credentials, API keys */],
    infrastructure: [/* databases, queues, etc. */]
  },

  // Deployment Lifecycle
  deploymentPhases: [/* ordered deployment steps */],

  // Validation
  validationChecks: [/* post-deployment validation */],
  healthChecks: [/* ongoing monitoring */],

  // Environment Overrides
  environmentOverrides: [/* dev, staging, prod differences */],

  // Metadata
  metadata: { source, lastUpdated, maintainer, tags, references }
}
```

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Consistency**: Same deployment approach for each platform type, every time

2. **Reproducibility**: Versioned patterns enable exact recreation of deployments

3. **Best Practices**: Automatically follows industry standards for each platform

4. **Multi-Platform Support**: Single system handles 7+ platforms with room for expansion

5. **Self-Learning**: Patterns evolve based on real-world deployment experience

6. **Reduced Errors**: Standardized approaches reduce human error

7. **Faster Onboarding**: New team members can use patterns without deep platform knowledge

8. **Documentation**: Patterns serve as living documentation of deployment processes

### Negative

1. **Initial Overhead**: Creating comprehensive patterns takes time upfront

2. **Maintenance Burden**: Patterns must be kept up-to-date with platform changes

3. **Flexibility Trade-off**: Standardization may limit customization for edge cases

4. **Learning Curve**: Team needs to understand pattern system

5. **Pattern Evolution**: Balancing pattern stability vs. incorporating learnings

### Risks

1. **Pattern Drift**: Patterns may diverge from current best practices if not maintained
   - **Mitigation**: Regular review cycle, automated checks against upstream sources

2. **Over-Standardization**: Patterns may not fit all project needs
   - **Mitigation**: Support custom patterns and pattern overrides

3. **Version Lock-in**: Patterns tied to specific platform versions
   - **Mitigation**: Version patterns, support multiple pattern versions

4. **False Detections**: Platform detection may misidentify project types
   - **Mitigation**: Allow manual pattern selection, show confidence scores

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Continue Ad-Hoc Approach

**Rejected**: Leads to continued inconsistency and tribal knowledge

### 2. Single Universal Pattern

**Rejected**: Platforms are too different for one-size-fits-all

### 3. External Tool Integration (Ansible, Terraform)

**Rejected**: Adds external dependencies, doesn't integrate with existing memory system

### 4. Platform-Specific Scripts Only

**Rejected**: No learning or evolution, difficult to maintain
