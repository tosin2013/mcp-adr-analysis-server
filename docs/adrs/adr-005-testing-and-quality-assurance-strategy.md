# ADR-005: Testing and Quality Assurance Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The MCP ADR Analysis Server requires comprehensive testing to ensure reliability of architectural analysis, AI integration, and MCP protocol compliance. Based on the project analysis and testing memories, the system has achieved high test coverage (100% in many modules) with sophisticated testing approaches including integration testing, CI/CD validation, and comprehensive test suites.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy emphasizing integration testing, protocol compliance validation, and systematic test coverage with automated quality gates.

Key components:

- **Integration-Focused Testing**: Emphasis on MCP protocol compliance and tool interaction
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing**: 100% coverage target for critical modules
- **CI/CD Quality Gates**: Automated testing in GitHub Actions workflows
- **Mock and Stub Infrastructure**: Sophisticated mocking for external dependencies
- **Performance Testing**: Analysis performance validation and benchmarking
- **Security Testing**: Automated security scanning and vulnerability detection

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- High confidence in system reliability through comprehensive test coverage
- Early detection of integration issues through protocol compliance testing
- Automated quality gates prevent regression and maintain code quality
- Sophisticated mocking enables isolated testing of complex AI workflows
- Performance testing ensures analysis scalability and responsiveness
- Security testing integration provides continuous vulnerability assessment

**Negative:**

- Increased development time due to comprehensive testing requirements
- Complexity in maintaining mock infrastructure for AI and external services
- Potential for test maintenance overhead as system evolves
- CI/CD pipeline complexity due to multiple testing phases and quality gates
- Resource requirements for running comprehensive test suites
- Need for ongoing test strategy evolution as new features are added
