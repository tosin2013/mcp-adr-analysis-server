# ADR-007: CI/CD Pipeline Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The MCP ADR Analysis Server requires a robust CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality, security, and reliable releases. The project needs automated testing, security scanning, dependency management, and release processes. Based on the implemented GitHub Actions workflows, the system uses a comprehensive multi-workflow approach with automated releases and extensive quality gates.

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline with multiple specialized workflows for different aspects of the development lifecycle.

Key components:

- **Multi-Workflow Architecture**: Separate workflows for build, test, lint, security, dependencies, and releases
- **Automated Quality Gates**: Pre-commit hooks, linting, testing, and security scanning
- **Automated Releases**: Semantic versioning with automated release notes generation
- **Security-First Approach**: CodeQL analysis, dependency scanning, and secret detection
- **Dependency Management**: Automated Dependabot updates with auto-merge capabilities
- **Documentation Automation**: Automated documentation updates and dashboard maintenance

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Comprehensive quality assurance through multiple automated checks
- Fast feedback loops with parallel workflow execution
- Automated security scanning reduces vulnerability exposure
- Consistent release process with semantic versioning
- Reduced manual overhead through automation
- Clear separation of concerns with specialized workflows

**Negative:**

- Increased complexity in managing multiple workflow files
- Potential for workflow conflicts and dependency issues
- Higher GitHub Actions usage and potential cost implications
- Need for careful coordination between automated processes
- Debugging complexity when workflows fail
- Maintenance overhead for keeping workflows updated
