## üöÄ Quick Start Prompting

### üìå Use `.mcp-server-context.md` First!

Before crafting prompts, reference the context file for instant server awareness:

```markdown
@.mcp-server-context.md
```

This gives you:

- ‚úÖ All available tools by category (37+ tools)
- ‚úÖ Current project state and recent activity
- ‚úÖ Active workflows and intents
- ‚úÖ Tool usage examples and capabilities

**See [Context File Referencing](#context-file-referencing) section below for details.**

### Essential Prompt Structure

```
[CONTEXT] + [TOOL_REQUEST] + [PARAMETERS] + [EXPECTED_OUTPUT]
```

### Example: Basic Project Analysis

```
Context: "I'm analyzing a Node.js microservices project"
Tool: "Use analyze_project_ecosystem"
Parameters: "with comprehensive analysis and AI enhancement enabled"
Output: "Provide architectural insights and ADR suggestions"
```

**Complete Prompt:**

> "I'm analyzing a Node.js microservices project. Use analyze_project_ecosystem with comprehensive analysis and AI enhancement enabled to provide architectural insights and ADR suggestions."

---

## üé® Basic Prompting Patterns

### Pattern 1: Single Tool Analysis

```markdown
**Template:**
"Analyze [PROJECT_TYPE] using [TOOL_NAME] with [SPECIFIC_PARAMETERS] to [DESIRED_OUTCOME]"

**Examples:**

- "Analyze this React application using analyze_project_ecosystem with enhanced mode enabled to identify missing ADRs"
- "Review existing ADRs using review_existing_adrs with tree-sitter analysis to assess compliance"
- "Check deployment readiness using deployment_readiness with strict validation for production environment"
```

### Pattern 2: Context-Rich Prompting

```markdown
**Template:**
"Given [CONTEXT], I need to [GOAL]. Please use [TOOL] with these considerations: [CONSTRAINTS]"

**Example:**
"Given that we're migrating from monolith to microservices, I need to document architectural decisions. Please use suggest_adrs with focus on distributed systems patterns and consider our existing Spring Boot stack."
```

### Pattern 3: Progressive Analysis

```markdown
**Template:**
"Start with [INITIAL_TOOL], then based on results, proceed with [FOLLOW_UP_TOOLS]"

**Example:**
"Start with analyze_project_ecosystem to understand the codebase, then use suggest_adrs to identify missing decisions, and finally generate_adr_todo to create implementation tasks."
```

## üß† Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Enable the server's advanced AI capabilities:

```markdown
**Enhanced Analysis Request:**
"Please analyze this project using methodological pragmatism:

1. First, use analyze_project_ecosystem with knowledge enhancement
2. Apply reflexion framework to validate findings
3. Generate confidence-scored recommendations
4. Provide explicit acknowledgment of limitations"
```

### Context File Referencing

**Use `.mcp-server-context.md` for instant server awareness:**

The `.mcp-server-context.md` file is auto-generated and provides comprehensive context about:

- All 37+ available tools by category
- Current server state and memory
- Active intents and workflow context
- Recent architectural decisions
- Project analysis history

**How to use:**

```markdown
# Reference the context file in your prompts:

@.mcp-server-context.md I'm new to this project. What architectural decisions have been made?

@.mcp-server-context.md What tools are available for security analysis?

@.mcp-server-context.md Show me the active intents and current workflow state.
```

**Benefits:**

- ‚úÖ Instant awareness of all server capabilities
- ‚úÖ Access to recent activity and decisions
- ‚úÖ Understanding of project-specific context
- ‚úÖ Tool discovery and usage guidance

**Related Documentation:**

- See [Server Context File Guide](./server-context-file.md) for detailed usage
- See [Context File Tool Coverage](../explanation/context-file-tool-coverage.md) for tool integration

### Memory-Centric Prompting

Leverage the memory system:

```markdown
**Memory Integration:**
"Load existing ADRs into memory using memory_loading, then analyze architectural gaps using the knowledge graph to suggest improvements with high confidence scoring."
```

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis

```markdown
**Comprehensive Assessment:**
"Perform a security-focused architectural analysis:

- Use analyze_content_security for vulnerability detection
- Apply tree-sitter analysis for deep code inspection
- Generate content masking recommendations
- Validate against enterprise security standards"
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tool-Specific Prompting

```markdown
"Analyze [PROJECT_PATH] using analyze_project_ecosystem with:

- Enhanced mode: true
- Knowledge enhancement: true
- Technology focus: [TECH_STACK]
- Analysis depth: comprehensive
- Include environment analysis: true

Focus on [SPECIFIC_AREAS] and provide confidence-scored insights."
```

**Parameters to Always Include:**

- `enhancedMode: true` - Enables APE + Knowledge Generation
- `knowledgeEnhancement: true` - Activates advanced AI features
- `analysisDepth: "comprehensive"` - Full analysis scope

### suggest_adrs

**Effective Prompting:**

```markdown
"Suggest ADRs for [PROJECT_CONTEXT] using suggest_adrs with:

- Before/after code analysis enabled

- Focus on [ARCHITECTURAL_CONCERNS]
- Include implementation guidance"
```

### content_masking_tool

**Security-Focused Prompting:**

```markdown
"Analyze security vulnerabilities using analyze_content_security with:

- Tree-sitter analysis enabled
- Custom pattern detection for [SPECIFIC_SECRETS]
- Generate masking strategies for [ENVIRONMENT]
- Validate masking effectiveness"
```

### deployment_readiness

**Production-Ready Prompting:**

```markdown
"Check deployment readiness using deployment_readiness with:

- Strict validation mode
- Environment: production
- Include mock vs production analysis
- Generate deployment guidance with confidence scoring"
```
