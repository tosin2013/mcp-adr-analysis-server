## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the Product Requirements for the **MCP ADR Analysis Server**, a sophisticated tool designed to analyze software projects, manage Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), and provide deep architectural insights through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

HARD RULES: 
  * You MUST follow https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#node
  * You MUST follow Core MCP Concepts
    * MCP servers can provide three main types of capabilities:
    * Resources: File-like data that can be read by clients (like API responses or file contents)
    * Tools: Functions that can be called by the LLM (with user approval)
    * Prompts: Pre-written templates that help users accomplish specific tasks
  * You must create a make file for this project driven by code quality and validation
  * You must create Github actions for linting, testing, and building the project
  * You must create a Github Pages site for this project
  * You must create a documentation site for this project
  * You must not push any secrets to the repository
  * You must not push PRD.md to the repository
  * You must not push any credentials to the repository
  * You must not push mcp-shrimp-task-manager to the repository


The server operates within a local project environment, typically a Git repository, and exposes its functionalities as a set of MCP Tools, Resources, and Prompts. Its primary user is an AI Agent (such as Claude or other LLMs) that leverages the server's capabilities to assist developers, architects, and project managers.

The core philosophy of the server is to act as an intelligent orchestrator and prompt engineer. It performs local file system analysis, builds a comprehensive understanding of the project's architecture, and offloads complex reasoning, NLP, and content generation tasks to the connected AI model. This ensures the system is both powerful in its analysis and flexible in its intelligence.

The server supports the entire development lifecycle, from generating initial ADRs from a PRD for new projects, to providing baseline analysis for in-progress applications, to tracking the implementation of ADRs through to deployment.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Architecture & Tech Stack
*   **Architecture:** The system will be a standalone MCP server adhering to the official MCP specification. It will communicate primarily via standard I/O (stdio) for local integration.
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Runtime:** Node.js
*   **Core Library:** `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` (^1.0.0)
*   **Schema Validation:** Zod
*   **File System:** `fast-glob` for file discovery.
*   **Testing:** Jest
*   **Linting:** ESLint v9 (flat config)

### Data Needs
*   **Primary Data Source:** The local file system of a user's Git repository.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   ADRs, `todo.md`, and research files will reside in `docs/adrs/` and `docs/research/`.
    *   The cache will be stored in `.mcp-adr-cache/`, which must be added to `.gitignore`.
*   **Data Structures:** The system will use detailed TypeScript interfaces for all major data entities, including `Adr`, `DetectedTechnology`, `DetectedPattern`, `ArchitecturalKnowledgeGraph`, `AdrTask`, and `Rule`. (Refer to the detailed interfaces defined during the information gathering phase).
*   **Data Flows:** The system will follow a set of well-defined data flows for its core processes, such as Baseline Analysis, ADR Generation from PRD, and Dynamic Todo Management. All flows originate from user/AI prompts and interact with the local file system, with results being cached and returned as structured MCP Resources.

### API Interactions
*   **Primary API:** The server's functionalities will be exposed exclusively through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
*   **MCP Tools:** A comprehensive set of MCP Tools will be provided, including `analyze_project_ecosystem`, `get_architectural_context`, `generate_adrs_from_prd`, `generate_adr_todo`, etc.
*   **MCP Resources:** The server will expose structured data as MCP Resources, such as `architectural_knowledge_graph`, `analysis_report`, and `adr_list`.
*   **MCP Prompts:** A rich set of MCP Prompts will be defined to enable interactive, context-aware, and AI-driven workflows. This includes prompts for goal specification, ambiguity resolution, action confirmation, and custom rule definition.
*   **External APIs:** The server **SHALL NOT** directly call any external APIs. It will rely on the AI agent to use other MCP tools to fetch external information and provide it as context.

---

## 6. Edge Cases & Error Handling

The server must be robust and handle errors gracefully.
*   **Invalid Input:** The server SHALL validate all inputs and return clear, actionable error messages for issues like non-existent files, malformed ADRs, or invalid regex patterns.
*   **Missing Information:** The server SHALL degrade functionality gracefully. If no ADRs are found, it will report this and proceed with code-based analysis. If a task is unverifiable, it will be marked as such without halting the system.
*   **Environmental Issues:** The server SHALL handle permissions errors and missing system dependencies (like Git) with clear error messages.
*   **Performance Issues:** The server SHALL use timeouts and caching to manage large repositories. For very large inputs, it may provide a preliminary analysis with a warning.
*   **AI Interaction Failures:** The server SHALL validate all responses from the AI agent against expected schemas (using Zod) and will re-prompt with clarifying messages if validation fails. It will handle connection losses gracefully.

---

## 7. Open Questions / Missing Information / Future Considerations

*   **Constraints:** The implementation must strictly follow the MCP `typescript-sdk` and its best practices. No other hard constraints on performance or resources are defined for this version.
*   **Open Questions:** The primary design principle to be continuously evaluated is **maximizing the leverage of the connected AI model**. The server's logic should focus on orchestration and prompt engineering, offloading complex reasoning to the AI.
*   **Future Considerations:** No features are explicitly out of scope for this comprehensive initial version. Future ideas (e.g., IDE integration, GUI for the knowledge graph) will be considered after this version is complete.
