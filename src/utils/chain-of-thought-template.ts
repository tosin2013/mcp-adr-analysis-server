Before proceeding with ${taskName}, please think through this systematically:

- Think: What do I need to accomplish in this step?
- Consider: What could go wrong or be misunderstood?
- Decide: What is the best approach for this specific situation?
- Validate: Does this step make sense given the context?

### ‚úÖ Validation Checklist
Before finalizing your response, verify:

### üö® Error Prevention
Watch out for these common issues:
${errorHandling.map(error => `- ‚ö†Ô∏è ${error}`).join('\n')}

### Meta-Thinking
- Am I making any assumptions that should be explicitly stated?
- Have I considered alternative approaches?
- Is my reasoning clear and logical?
- Would another person be able to follow my thought process?

## üìù Your Response Format

Please structure your response as follows:

1. **Thinking Process**: Show your step-by-step reasoning
2. **Decision Points**: Explain key decisions and why you made them  
3. **Validation**: Confirm you've checked against the validation criteria
4. **Final Output**: Provide the requested analysis/results

Remember: Think out loud, show your work, and be explicit about your reasoning process.`;
