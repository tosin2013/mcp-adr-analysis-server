# GitHub Push Protection Bypass Instructions

## Issue

GitHub's push protection is detecting a Twilio Account SID in the commit history that has been fixed but still appears in previous commits.

## The Secret

The detected string was a **test placeholder** in `tests/utils/tree-sitter-analyzer.test.ts` and is **NOT a real secret**. It has been replaced with a safe placeholder pattern.

## Safe to Bypass

This detection is a **false positive** because:

1. The string was test data, not a real Twilio Account SID
2. It has been properly replaced with a placeholder
3. The commit contains security improvements including proper secret scanning

## Bypass Instructions

To push these security improvements, use the GitHub URL provided in the error message:

1. Visit the URL provided by GitHub (appears in git push error)
2. Click "Allow secret" since this is a false positive
3. The string will be allowlisted for this repository
4. Push will proceed normally

## Future Prevention

The implemented gitleaks configuration and pre-commit hooks will prevent real secrets from being committed in the future.

## Security Verification

✅ Real secret scanning implemented with gitleaks
✅ Pre-commit hooks block actual secrets
✅ Test data uses safe placeholder patterns
✅ Documentation updated to avoid triggering false positives
