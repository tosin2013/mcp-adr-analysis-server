# ADR-002: API Authentication Strategy

## Status
Proposed

## Context
Our API endpoints need secure authentication and authorization. We need to support both web applications and mobile clients, with different access patterns and security requirements.

## Decision
Implement JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Consequences

### Implementation Requirements
1. **Token Management**
   - JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry
   - Refresh tokens with 7-day expiry
   - Secure token storage and rotation

2. **Authorization Layer**
   - Role-based permissions system
   - Resource-level access controls
   - Admin dashboard for user management

3. **Security Measures**
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Audit logging for security events

### Next Steps
- [ ] CRITICAL: Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] HIGH: Create user role management system
- [ ] HIGH: Set up refresh token rotation
- [ ] MEDIUM: Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] LOW: Create admin user management interface
