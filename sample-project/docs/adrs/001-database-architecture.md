# ADR-001: Database Architecture Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select a database solution for our microservices architecture. The system needs to handle high-throughput user data, support ACID transactions, and provide good horizontal scaling capabilities.

## Decision
We will use PostgreSQL as our primary database with Redis for caching and session management.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong ACID compliance and data consistency
- Excellent JSON support for flexible schemas
- Strong ecosystem and tooling support
- Good performance characteristics

### Negative
- More complex setup than NoSQL alternatives
- Requires careful query optimization for scale

## Implementation Tasks
- [ ] Set up PostgreSQL cluster with replication
- [ ] Configure connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- [ ] Implement database migration system
- [ ] Set up Redis cluster for caching
- [ ] Create backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting
