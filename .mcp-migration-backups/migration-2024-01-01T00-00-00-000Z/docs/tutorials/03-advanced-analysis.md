## üõ°Ô∏è Step 1: Comprehensive Security Analysis

### Understanding Security in Architecture

Security isn't just about code - it's about architectural decisions that affect your entire system:

- **Data flow and storage decisions**
- **Authentication and authorization architecture**
- **Network security and API design**
- **Deployment and infrastructure security**

### Deep Security Scanning

Start with a comprehensive security analysis of your project:

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_content_security",
  "parameters": {
    "content": "Scan entire project for security vulnerabilities and sensitive information",
    "contentType": "code",
    "userDefinedPatterns": [
      "api[_-]?key.*=.*[\"'][^\"']+[\"']",
      "secret[_-]?token.*=.*[\"'][^\"']+[\"']",
      "password.*=.*[\"'][^\"']+[\"']",
      "private[_-]?key.*=.*[\"'][^\"']+[\"']"
    ]
  }
}
```

**Common Security Issues Detected:**

- **Hardcoded API keys** in configuration files
- **Database passwords** in environment files
- **Private keys** committed to repository
- **Session secrets** in code
- **Third-party tokens** in configuration

### Configure Project-Specific Security Patterns

Every project has unique security considerations:

```json
{
  "tool": "configure_custom_patterns",
  "parameters": {
    "projectPath": ".",
    "existingPatterns": [
      "internal[_-]?api[_-]?url",
      "admin[_-]?secret",
      "encryption[_-]?key",
      "jwt[_-]?secret"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Generate Security Masking Strategy

```json
{
  "tool": "generate_content_masking",
  "parameters": {
    "content": "Configuration file with sensitive information",
    "detectedItems": [
      {
        "type": "api_key",
        "content": "sk-1234567890abcdef",
        "startPosition": 45,
        "endPosition": 65,
        "severity": "high"
      }
    ],
    "maskingStrategy": "environment"
  }
}
```

### Exercise: Security ADR Creation

**Create a comprehensive security ADR:**

1. **Document your authentication architecture**
2. **Identify data protection mechanisms**
3. **Document network security decisions**
4. **Create incident response procedures**

```json
{
  "tool": "generate_adr_from_decision",
  "parameters": {
    "decisionData": {
      "title": "Security Architecture - Defense in Depth Strategy",
      "context": "Application handles sensitive user data and requires comprehensive security across all layers.",
      "decision": "Multi-layered security architecture with authentication, authorization, encryption, and monitoring",
      "rationale": "Defense in depth provides multiple security barriers, reducing risk if any single layer is compromised. Industry best practice for applications handling sensitive data.",
      "consequences": [
        "Comprehensive protection against multiple attack vectors",
        "Improved compliance with security standards",
        "Higher complexity in implementation and maintenance",
        "Need for security expertise across development team",
        "Performance overhead from multiple security checks"
      ]
    },
    "adrDirectory": "docs/adrs"
  }
}
```

---

## üöÄ Step 2: Performance Architecture Analysis

### Performance-Related Architectural Decisions

Performance isn't just about optimization - it's about architectural decisions that affect scalability:

- **Database design and query patterns**
- **Caching strategies and data flow**
- **API design and communication patterns**
- **Frontend architecture and asset delivery**

### Analyze Performance Architecture

```json
{
  "tool": "analyze_project_ecosystem",
  "parameters": {
    "projectPath": ".",
    "enhancedMode": true,
    "recursiveDepth": "comprehensive",
    "conversationContext": {
      "focusAreas": ["performance", "scalability"],
      "constraints": ["high-traffic", "low-latency"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Generate Performance-Focused ADRs

Based on your analysis, document key performance decisions:

```json
{
  "tool": "suggest_adrs",
  "parameters": {
    "projectPath": ".",
    "analysisScope": "architecture",
    "maxSuggestions": 5,
    "conversationContext": {
      "userRequest": "Focus on performance and scalability architectural decisions"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example: Caching Strategy ADR

```json
{
  "tool": "generate_adr_from_decision",
  "parameters": {
    "decisionData": {
      "title": "Caching Architecture - Multi-Layer Strategy",
      "context": "Application serves high-traffic loads with frequently accessed data that changes infrequently.",
      "decision": "Multi-layer caching with Redis for application cache, CDN for static assets, and database query caching",
      "rationale": "Reduces database load by 80%, improves response times to <100ms for cached content, and provides horizontal scaling capability. Proven pattern for high-traffic applications.",
      "consequences": [
        "Significantly improved response times and user experience",
        "Reduced database load and improved overall system capacity",
        "Cache invalidation complexity requires careful coordination",
        "Additional infrastructure components to monitor and maintain",
        "Potential for cache consistency issues during updates"
      ]
    },
    "adrDirectory": "docs/adrs"
  }
}
```

### Exercise: Performance Audit

**Conduct a performance architecture review:**

1. **Identify bottlenecks** in your current architecture
2. **Document caching decisions** (or lack thereof)
3. **Analyze database query patterns** and indexing strategies
4. **Review API design** for efficiency
5. **Create performance-focused ADRs** for major decisions
