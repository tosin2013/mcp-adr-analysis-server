## 🏗️ Implementation Components

### 1. Enhanced Test Infrastructure (`tests/utils/test-infrastructure.ts`)

**Core Features:**

- **Resource Tracking**: Monitors temp directories, file handles, timers, intervals, and processes
- **Memory Management**: Tracks memory usage and enforces limits
- **Cleanup Management**: Provides graceful and force cleanup capabilities
- **Configuration Management**: Dynamic timeout and resource limit configuration
- **Environment Adaptation**: Automatically adjusts settings for CI/coverage environments

**Key Classes:**

```typescript
class TestInfrastructure {
  // Singleton pattern for global resource management
  // Tracks all test resources and provides cleanup
  // Configurable timeouts and limits
  // Memory monitoring and leak detection
}
```

### 2. Test Helper Utilities (`tests/utils/test-helpers.ts`)

**Test Type Decorators:**

- `unitTest()` - Executes with unit test timeouts and resource tracking
- `integrationTest()` - Executes with integration test timeouts
- `performanceTest()` - Executes with performance test timeouts and benchmarking

**Resource Management:**

- `createTestFile()` - Creates temporary files with automatic cleanup
- `createTestDirectory()` - Creates temporary directory structures
- `createMockTimer()` - Creates tracked timers for proper cleanup
- `expectNoResourceLeaks()` - Validates no resource leaks occurred

**Performance Monitoring:**

- `PerformanceBenchmark` class for timing and memory tracking
- `expectMemoryUsage()` - Validates memory usage within limits
- `createBenchmark()` - Creates performance measurement tools

### 3. Test Configuration System (`tests/utils/test-config.ts`)

**Environment Detection:**

- Automatically detects CI, coverage, and debug environments
- Adjusts timeouts and resource limits accordingly
- Provides configuration presets (FAST, THOROUGH, CI)

**Dynamic Configuration:**

```typescript
const config = {
  timeouts: {
    unit: isCI ? 15000 : 10000,
    integration: isCI ? 60000 : 30000,
    performance: isCI ? 180000 : 120000,
  },
  performance: {
    maxMemoryMB: isCoverage ? 1024 : 512,
    // ... other limits
  },
};
```

### 4. Enhanced Test Setup (`tests/setup.ts`)

**Improvements:**

- Dynamic timeout configuration based on test type
- Memory usage monitoring and reporting
- Resource leak detection and warnings
- Proper console mocking with cleanup
- Graceful shutdown with timeout handling

### 5. Test Infrastructure Script (`scripts/test-infrastructure.sh`)

**Features:**

- System resource checking before test execution
- Resource monitoring during test runs
- Comprehensive test reporting
- Multiple test suite execution (unit, integration, performance)
- Cleanup and validation utilities

**Usage:**

```bash
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh unit        # Run unit tests
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh integration # Run integration tests
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh performance # Run performance tests
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh validate   # Validate infrastructure
./scripts/test-infrastructure.sh cleanup    # Clean up resources
```

### 6. Enhanced Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)

**Improvements:**

- Dynamic timeout configuration
- Memory management settings
- Enhanced error handling
- Improved test isolation
- CI-specific optimizations

## 📊 Timeout Configurations

### Environment-Aware Timeouts

| Test Type   | Local | CI   | Debug |
| ----------- | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| Unit        | 10s   | 15s  | 30s   |
| Integration | 30s   | 60s  | 120s  |
| Performance | 120s  | 180s | 300s  |

### Resource Limits

| Resource     | Local | CI    | Coverage |
| ------------ | ----- | ----- | -------- |
| Memory       | 256MB | 512MB | 1024MB   |
| Temp Dirs    | 50    | 50    | 50       |
| File Handles | 100   | 100   | 100      |

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Using Enhanced Test Infrastructure

```typescript
import { unitTest, createTestFile, expectNoResourceLeaks } from '../utils/test-helpers.js';

describe('MyComponent', () => {
  unitTest('should work correctly', async () => {
    const testFile = await createTestFile('test content');

    // Your test logic here

    expectNoResourceLeaks();
  });
});
```

### Performance Testing

```typescript
import { performanceTest, createBenchmark } from '../utils/test-helpers.js';

describe('Performance Tests', () => {
  performanceTest('should handle large datasets', async () => {
    const benchmark = createBenchmark();

    benchmark.start();
    // Your performance test logic
    benchmark.end();

    benchmark.expectDurationLessThan(1000);
    benchmark.expectMemoryDeltaLessThan(50);
  });
});
```

### Resource Tracking

```typescript
import { withResourceTracking, testInfrastructure } from '../utils/test-helpers.js';

it(
  'should track resources',
  withResourceTracking(async tracker => {
    // Test logic that uses resources
    // Resources are automatically tracked and cleaned up
  })
);
```
