# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical issues in the TODO management system that are causing test failures. The system currently has problems with task persistence, bulk operations, partial ID matching, and missing core operations like delete, archive, and undo functionality. These issues prevent users from effectively managing their tasks and cause the test suite to fail.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Task Persistence and Retrieval

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tasks to persist correctly after creation so that I can retrieve and manage them reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a task is created THEN the system SHALL store it persistently in both JSON backend and markdown files
2. WHEN a task is retrieved by ID THEN the system SHALL return the correct task data
3. WHEN tasks are listed THEN the system SHALL show all previously created tasks
4. WHEN the system restarts THEN all previously created tasks SHALL remain accessible

### Requirement 2: Task ID Management and Partial Matching

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use partial task IDs for convenience while maintaining unique identification.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a partial task ID is provided THEN the system SHALL match it to the correct full task ID
2. WHEN multiple tasks match a partial ID THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with suggestions
3. WHEN an invalid task ID format is provided THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN a task ID is not found THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative actions

### Requirement 3: Bulk Operations Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform operations on multiple tasks simultaneously to improve efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN bulk update is requested THEN the system SHALL update all specified tasks atomically
2. WHEN bulk delete is requested THEN the system SHALL delete all specified tasks with confirmation
3. WHEN bulk operations encounter errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback about successes and failures
4. WHEN dry-run mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL show what would be changed without making actual changes

### Requirement 4: Missing Core Operations

**User Story:** As a user, I want access to essential task management operations like delete, archive, and undo.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN delete_task operation is called THEN the system SHALL remove the task and handle dependencies
2. WHEN archive_task operation is called THEN the system SHALL move completed tasks to archive
3. WHEN undo operation is called THEN the system SHALL reverse the last operation
4. WHEN force delete is used THEN the system SHALL handle dependency conflicts appropriately

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Search and Find Capabilities

**User Story:** As a user, I want powerful search capabilities to find tasks quickly using various criteria.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN fuzzy search is used THEN the system SHALL handle typos and approximate matches
2. WHEN multi-field search is used THEN the system SHALL search across title, description, and tags
3. WHEN regex search is used THEN the system SHALL support pattern-based matching
4. WHEN no results are found THEN the system SHALL provide helpful search suggestions

### Requirement 6: Task Validation and Constraints

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to prevent invalid task configurations and maintain data integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN circular dependencies are created THEN the system SHALL prevent them and show clear errors
2. WHEN invalid priority values are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and reject them
3. WHEN malformed dates are provided THEN the system SHALL validate and provide helpful error messages
4. WHEN task constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance for resolution

### Requirement 7: Operation History and Undo Support

**User Story:** As a user, I want to track my operations and undo mistakes to maintain confidence in task management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN operations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain an operation history
2. WHEN undo is requested THEN the system SHALL reverse the most recent operation
3. WHEN operation history is requested THEN the system SHALL show recent operations with timestamps
4. WHEN multiple undo operations are needed THEN the system SHALL support sequential undo

### Requirement 8: Performance and Stability Under Load

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle rapid operations and large datasets reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rapid successive operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data consistency
2. WHEN large numbers of tasks exist THEN the system SHALL perform operations efficiently
3. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL prevent data corruption
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL degrade gracefully
