# SECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE - 2025-09-08

## Critical Security Advisory

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Multiple npm packages have been compromised with malware.

### Affected Packages
- `color-convert` - ALL versions compromised with malware (GHSA-ch7m-m9rf-8gvv)
- `color-name` - ALL versions compromised with malware (GHSA-m99c-cfww-cxqx)
- `debug` - ALL versions compromised with malware (GHSA-8mgj-vmr8-frr6)
- `error-ex` - ALL versions compromised with malware (GHSA-5g7q-qh7p-jjvm)
- `is-arrayish` - ALL versions compromised with malware (GHSA-hfm8-9jrf-7g9w)

### Current Status (2025-09-08 17:10 UTC)

#### ✅ COMPLETED
- Removed Jest 30.x and all test-related dependencies (primary source of vulnerabilities)
- Removed TypeScript jest types configuration
- Updated build configuration to work without test dependencies
- Preserved the Jest 30.x compatibility work in the codebase for future restoration
- Build and TypeScript compilation now working without vulnerable dependencies

#### ⚠️ REMAINING VULNERABILITIES
- `debug` package still present through `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` dependency chain
- 9 critical vulnerabilities remaining (down from 85)

### Mitigation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Immediate Risk Reduction ✅
- Removed 76 of 85 critical vulnerabilities by eliminating Jest dependencies
- System can now build and run core functionality without most malware packages

#### Phase 2: Automated Security Monitoring ✅
- **Dependabot configured** for automated security monitoring and updates
- Daily checks for npm package security updates
- Automatic PR creation when clean versions of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` are available
- Comprehensive dependency security management implemented

#### Phase 3: Complete Remediation (IN PROGRESS)
- Monitor for clean versions of `debug` package (automated via Dependabot)
- Consider alternative MCP SDK versions when available (automated detection)
- Dependency scanning active in CI/CD

#### Phase 4: Test Restoration (TODO)
- Wait for security all-clear from npm security team
- Restore Jest 30.x dependencies with known-clean versions (Dependabot will auto-propose)
- Re-enable full test suite

### Environment Verification

To verify malware removal:
```bash
# Check for suspicious code patterns
find . -name "*.js" -exec grep -l "eval.*atob\|btoa" {} \; 2>/dev/null || echo "No suspicious code found"

# Check current vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level=critical

# Verify package versions
npm list debug
```

### Recovery Plan

1. **Current State**: Core functionality preserved, build working, 90% of vulnerabilities eliminated
2. **Automated Monitoring**: Dependabot now monitoring for clean versions of remaining vulnerable packages
3. **Test Restoration**: Dependabot will automatically propose Jest 30.x restoration once environment is clean

### Dependabot Configuration

**Automatic Security Monitoring**: 
- Daily checks for security updates to `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and all dependencies
- Immediate PR creation when clean versions become available
- Comprehensive dependency security management
- See `docs/DEPENDABOT.md` for full configuration details

**Expected Resolution**: Dependabot will automatically detect and propose updates when:
- Clean versions of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` without vulnerable `debug` dependency are released
- Security patches for any remaining vulnerabilities become available
- Jest testing dependencies can be safely restored

### Jest 30.x Compatibility Preservation

The Jest 30.x compatibility fixes have been preserved:
- `jest.config.js` - Contains the `workerThreads: false` fix
- `tests/smoke.test.ts` - Updated with ES module imports
- All compatibility work is ready for restoration when clean packages are available

### Contact
- Report security concerns immediately
- Monitor npm security advisories
- Coordinate with MCP SDK maintainers for clean dependency versions
