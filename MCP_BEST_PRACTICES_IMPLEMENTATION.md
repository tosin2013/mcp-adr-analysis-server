# MCP Best Practices Implementation

This document describes the implementation of MCP best practices in the ADR Analysis Server.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Best Practices

### 1. Roots System

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**Location**: `src/utils/root-manager.ts`, `src/index.ts`

**What it does**:
- Provides codified file system access control
- Enables autonomous file discovery for Claude
- Defines accessible directories (roots) for the MCP server

**Roots defined**:
1. **project** - Project source code and configuration (`PROJECT_PATH`)
2. **adrs** - Architectural Decision Records (`ADR_DIRECTORY`)

**Tools added**:
- `list_roots` - Lists all accessible roots
- `read_directory` - Lists files and folders in a directory
- `read_file` - Updated to use root-based access control

**Example usage**:
```json
// List available roots
{ "tool": "list_roots" }

// Explore ADR directory
{ "tool": "read_directory", "args": { "path": "docs/adrs" } }

// Read a specific ADR
{ "tool": "read_file", "args": { "path": "docs/adrs/0001-use-adrs.md" } }
```

**Security benefits**:
- Centralized path validation
- Clear permission boundaries
- Better error messages with accessible root information

### 2. Stdio Transport (Current Implementation)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Appropriate for Private Use

**Location**: `src/index.ts:7025`

**What it is**:
- Standard Input/Output transport for same-machine operation
- Recommended transport for private/local MCP servers
- Full bidirectional communication support

**Why this is correct for your use case**:
- ‚úÖ Server is not hosted publicly
- ‚úÖ Runs on same machine as client
- ‚úÖ No need for HTTP/SSE complexity
- ‚úÖ Better performance than HTTP transport

**No changes needed** - This is already the right approach.

## üîÑ Optional Enhancements (Not Required)

### Progress Notifications

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**What it does**:
- Provides real-time feedback during long-running tool execution
- Reports progress percentages (0-100%)
- Sends informational messages about current phase
- Enhances user experience with visual progress tracking

**Implemented in**:

1. **`performResearch`** - Multi-phase research with 5 progress checkpoints:
   - Phase 1: Initializing research framework (10%)
   - Phase 2: Collecting research data (30%)
   - Phase 3: Analyzing collected data (70%)
   - Completion (100%)

2. **`analyzeProjectEcosystem`** - Comprehensive ecosystem analysis with 7 checkpoints:
   - Phase 1: Analyzing project structure (10%)
   - Phase 2: Generating architectural knowledge (25%)
   - Phase 3: Scanning project files (40%)
   - Phase 4: Analyzing environment (55%)
   - Phase 5: Applying learning and reflexion (70%)
   - Phase 6: Executing AI analysis (85%)
   - Completion (100%)

3. **`generateAdrsFromPrd`** - ADR generation with 7 checkpoints:
   - Phase 1: Validating PRD file (10%)
   - Phase 2: Reading PRD content (25%)
   - Phase 3: Generating domain knowledge (40%)
   - Phase 4: Creating base ADR prompts (60%)
   - Phase 5: Optimizing prompts with APE (75%)
   - Phase 6: Executing AI-powered generation (90%)
   - Completion (100%)

4. **`discoverExistingAdrs`** - ADR discovery with 3 checkpoints:
   - Phase 1: Scanning ADR directory (30%)
   - Phase 2: Analyzing ADR files (60%)
   - Completion (100%)

**How it works**:
```typescript
// Tool handler creates context with info() and report_progress() methods
const context: ToolContext = {
  info: (message: string) => this.logger.info(message),
  report_progress: (progress: number, total?: number) => {
    const percentage = total ? Math.round((progress / total) * 100) : progress;
    this.logger.info(`Progress: ${percentage}%`);
  }
};

// Tools receive context and report progress
async performResearch(args, context?: ToolContext) {
  const ctx = context || createNoOpContext();
  ctx.info('üîç Starting research...');
  ctx.report_progress(0, 100);
  // ... work ...
  ctx.info('‚úÖ Completed');
  ctx.report_progress(100, 100);
}
```

## ‚ùå Not Needed for This Server

### Sampling (Not Required)

**Why NOT needed**:
- ‚úÖ Server uses direct OpenRouter API (`ai-executor.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Server is private, not publicly hosted
- ‚úÖ API key security is not a concern (local use)
- ‚úÖ Simpler architecture for private deployment

**When you WOULD need sampling**:
- If server were hosted publicly
- If you wanted clients to control LLM access
- If you wanted to avoid server-side API costs

**Current approach is correct** for private use.

---

### HTTP Transport (Not Required)

**Why NOT needed**:
- ‚úÖ Server runs locally on same machine as client
- ‚úÖ Stdio transport is more efficient for same-machine
- ‚úÖ No need for remote hosting capabilities
- ‚úÖ Simpler deployment and configuration

**When you WOULD need HTTP transport**:
- If server needed to be hosted remotely
- If multiple clients needed to connect over network
- If deploying as a cloud service

**Current approach is correct** for private use.

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Test Roots System

```bash
# Build the server
npm run build

# Test with MCP Inspector
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js

# Then in inspector:
# 1. Call "list_roots" tool
# 2. Call "read_directory" with path from roots
# 3. Call "read_file" with a file from the directory
# 4. Try "read_file" with path outside roots (should fail with helpful error)
```

### Test Security

```bash
# This should succeed (within project root)
read_file({ path: "package.json" })

# This should succeed (within ADR directory)
read_file({ path: "docs/adrs/0001-example.md" })

# This should fail with helpful error (outside roots)
read_file({ path: "/etc/passwd" })
```

## üéØ Conclusion

**Your MCP server now follows all applicable best practices:**

‚úÖ **Roots implemented** - Autonomous file discovery + security
‚úÖ **Correct transport** - Stdio for private use
‚úÖ **Correct AI approach** - Direct API for private use
‚úÖ **Progress notifications** - Real-time feedback for long-running operations

**No further changes required** unless you plan to:
- Deploy publicly (then add sampling + HTTP transport)
- Add progress notifications to additional tools (optional UX enhancement)
