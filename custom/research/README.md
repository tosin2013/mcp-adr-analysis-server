## Research Guidelines

### Creating New Research

1. Use the `generate_research_questions` MCP tool to create research questions
2. Create a new `perform_research_*.md` file using the research documentation utilities
3. Update this index file to include the new research
4. Begin research execution following the documented methodology

### Research Process

1. **Planning**: Define questions, methodology, and timeline
2. **Execution**: Collect data and conduct analysis
3. **Documentation**: Record findings with evidence and confidence levels
4. **Review**: Peer review and validation of findings
5. **Communication**: Share findings with stakeholders
6. **Implementation**: Apply recommendations and track outcomes

### Quality Standards

- All findings must include confidence levels and supporting evidence
- Research methodology must be clearly documented
- Regular progress updates are required
- Peer review is mandatory for critical findings
- All research must link to relevant ADRs and architectural decisions

### Documentation Standards

- Use the provided research document template
- Include clear research questions and methodology
- Document all findings with dates and confidence levels
- Provide actionable recommendations with implementation guidance
- Link to relevant ADRs and external references

## Research Tools

### MCP Tools Available

- `generate_research_questions`: Generate context-aware research questions
- `analyze_environment`: Analyze environment context for research
- `generate_rules`: Generate architectural rules from research findings

### Research Methodologies

- Literature review and analysis
- Experimental validation and testing
- Prototype development and evaluation
- Stakeholder interviews and surveys
- Architectural analysis and modeling

## Knowledge Management

### Research Findings Integration

- Update relevant ADRs with research findings
- Create new ADRs based on research recommendations
- Update architectural documentation with new insights
- Share findings through team knowledge sharing sessions

### Research Archive

- Completed research is archived but remains accessible
- Research findings are integrated into project knowledge base
- Lessons learned are documented for future research
- Research methodologies are refined based on experience
